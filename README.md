# TikTok-Trend-Detection

### Business Objective
The client is a leading company in developing consumer products for the home. Its product development process is initiated by various factors such as retail partners, industry trends, competitorsâ€™ actions, information from teams and factories, social media buzz, reviews, and google trends. Currently, its internal data analytics system is only gathering data from Amazon (rankings, reviews). Its analytics team does research online with known keywords and uses that information to decide whether a product is or will be a trend. They then pitch the idea to a retail partner and move forward.

The client is now looking into building an engine that utilizes social media data to identify trends in its product categories and related content in the industry automatically. The engine will unveil product trends on social media and speed up the overall new product development process, creating competitive advantages and innovative opportunities for its business endeavors.

### Project Objectives
Create a pipeline/process to source and analyze social media data and predict the future trend of kitchenware and/or household products.
- Use Rapid API to collect social media data.
- Use programming languages, preferably Python, to clean and analyze possible trends. 
- Identify trendy products before the peak of the trend.

### Outcomes
Mona led a team of 5 students and collectively built a pipeline that collects TikTok data through API and audio recognition python packages, cleanses and transforms text data with NLP techniques, and detects trends through time series analysis. 

The methodology was deployed to identify social media trends to be included in a dashboard for product managers. Product managers can explore analysis results, extract insights and make new product development decisions backed by social listening data. This analysis showcases viral or potential trends and is crucial for the client company's negotiation with partner vendors.
